Assumptions:
1. The average speed of 20 km/hr is used to calculate travel time between locations.
2. Preparation times for each restaurant are known and constant.
3. Aman can deliver one order at a time.
4. Orders cannot be delivered before they are prepared by the respective restaurants.
5. Aman starts from his current location and returns there after completing all deliveries.
6. Made it extensible for more restaurant and delivery executive.


Here is the documentation for each method, explaining their purpose and usage:

Location class:
Represents a location on the map with a name, latitude, and longitude coordinates.
Used to define the positions of Aman, restaurants, consumers, and delivery executives.


Order class:
Represents an order to be delivered, including the restaurant, consumer, delivery executive, and preparation time.
Used to encapsulate information about each order.


calculateDistance method:
Purpose: Calculates the distance between two locations using the Haversine formula.
Usage:
Accepts two Location objects as parameters.
Returns the distance in kilometers between the two locations.


calculateTravelTime method:
Purpose: Calculates the travel time based on the distance and average speed.
Usage:
Accepts the distance to be traveled in kilometers as a parameter.
Returns the time required to travel the given distance in hours.


calculateTotalTime method:
Purpose: Calculates the total time required for delivering orders, including preparation and travel time.
Usage:
Accepts a list of Order objects and the location of the delivery executive as parameters.
Returns the total time required for delivering all orders in hours.


nearestNeighbor method:
Purpose: Finds the nearest neighbor path using the given distance matrix.
Usage:
Accepts a distance matrix representing the distances between locations as a parameter.
Returns a list of indices representing the nearest neighbor path.

main method:
Purpose: Entry point of the program.
Usage:
Initializes locations, orders, and calculates the total time for delivering orders.
These methods collectively enable the calculation of the shortest delivery route and total time for a batch of orders to be delivered efficiently.
